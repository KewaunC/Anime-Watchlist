## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** EJS, CSS, JS, EXPRESS, MONGODB, REACT 

I had wanted to create something where anime lovers wouldnt have to worry about what anime's they have or haven't watched. Worry not this is a way for you to keep track of your anime!

## Optimizations

First time experimenting with MongoDB and I want to make it more forum base so other users could input.

## Lessons Learned:

This was an experience!! It was my first time working with MongoDB and also looking back at this project I'm going to scrap it and make a new watchlist so many things that I want to see implemented now!
