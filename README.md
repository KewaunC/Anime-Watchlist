# Anime-Watchlist

How its Made: JS, EJS, EXPRESS 

Focus for making this: I wanted to make an application where users could track which animes they watched and add comments to how they felt aboit said show

What could I have optimized: Make it more forum base so other users could input

Lessons Learned: This was a bit more challening than I tjought it was since it is one of the first FullStack Applications that I ever made!
